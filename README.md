# comp15-stuff
A master repo of all of the projects I enjoyed from my data structures class/Want to use as reference for future classes or interviews.

###Playlist manager:
A splay tree that acts as an "iTunes" account manager. Has capabilities to insert, delete, lookup, find approximate matches. Outputs trees in DOTTY format to check if splaying correctly.

###Dictionary Hashtable:
Pretty straightforward-- implements a Hashtable to look up words in a large dictionary. Gotta love those prime numbers and O(1). I was amazed at how fast it ran.

###Sorting Algorithims
Various sorting algorithims, implemented and compared to one another in terms of time to sort an array of 1000 items.

###Infix to postfix:
Implements a stack and various operations to convert an infix operation to a postfix notation, and then perform said operations.
